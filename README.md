Project where I discuss and implement the architecture of different NN to address the problem of monocular depth estimation. We go over the theory and implementation with Pytorch of encoders, vision transformers, reassmble layers, and residual neural networks.
I also discuss robust loss functions of disparity maps.
Due to several limitations, the results from this experiment were not good enough, however this serves as a good discussion of how to go from papers to code implementation.
