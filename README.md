Project where I discuss and implement the architectures of various neural networks to address the problem of monocular depth estimation. I cover the theory and PyTorch implementation of encoders, vision transformers, reassemble layers, and residual neural networks.

I also discuss robust loss functions for disparity maps.

Due to several limitations, the results from this experiment were not satisfactory. However, this serves as a valuable discussion on transitioning from research papers to code implementation.
